The concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Key take away here is data-ownership. you are in control of your data. but superpower does comes with responsibility. You need to ensure that you've harden everything before going deploying and this might require some field expertise in it.

## My current setup
- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) -  faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec. better performant than OpenVPN and now it will merge in linux kernel soon. [(Digital Ocean tutorial)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-point-to-point-vpn-with-wireguard-on-ubuntu-16-04)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - easy password manager with regular [third party](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_bitwarden.pdf) audits. ([Eelectric monk review](https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2018/05/01/a-short-security-review-of-bitwarden/))
- [Calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) — E-Book manager, packed with all you need features
- [Wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) — lightweight and extensible wiki made with Node.js. ([GitHub](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki))

## Work in Progress

- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) — network-wide ad blocking software you can deploy to local Raspberry Pi.([GitHub](https://github.com/pi-hole))
- [Unbound](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound) — validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver.
