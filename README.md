# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/welcome.png)

This is my personal knowledge base where I'll attempt to share [everything I know](sharing/everything-i-know.md) about this world in form of an online GitBook hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xlucipher/knowledge).

## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](other/wiki-workflow.md#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
